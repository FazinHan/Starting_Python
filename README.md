# Starting python
This is a repo containing all my beginner python code. I wrote these while learning (although, admittedly, 
I have had some prior experience with python). 
I used Python version 3.8 for all the code in this repository.

The modules imported in code so far are:
1. Math
2. Numpy
3. Random
4. Matplotlib
