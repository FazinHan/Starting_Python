# Starting python
This is a repo containing all my beginner python code. I wrote these while learning (although, admittedly, 
I have had some prior experience with python). 
I used Python version 3.8 for all the code in this repository. `launcher.py ` displays a list of executable python scripts that can be run by simply entering the number of the script in the list. Not a necessity just something fun.

###### Note: Repo created on windows, `launcher.py` will not work on other operating systems.
